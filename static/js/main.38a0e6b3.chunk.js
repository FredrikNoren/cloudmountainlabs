Why not!\n\nBerlin - July 28, 2020 -- It\u2019s been a little over two years since the scientists at OpenAI managed to beat top DOTA players using neural networks trained by playing against themselves. Upstart Mount Rouke Studios is now betting that they can make a simplified version of that technology into a PC game, which is launching in early access today.\n\nThe game, called \u201cDr. Derk\u2019s Mutant Battlegrounds\u201d, looks like a quirky western themed version of a MOBA with two sides facing each other and \u201cstatues\u201d they need to defend. But instead of player controlled heroes, the two sides have \u201cDerklings\u201d, a boxy dinosaur looking creature, that the players have trained beforehand. The goal is to figure out how to best equip and train your Derklings to beat the opponents.\n\nIt\u2019s a funny and bizarre game where the Derklings can be equipped by the player with anything from huge guns to bubblegum, and they can be trained against a number of enemies such as a scarecrow, a duck and a crab. However due to the fact that what you\u2019re actually training is their neural networks, there\u2019s a huge amount of depth to the game as there are almost limitless behaviours they could be trained to do.\n\nThe world of artificial intelligence is moving incredibly fast, and for a layman this game may be the easiest way out there to experiment with it first hand.\n\nSee the launch trailer: https://youtu.be/-Lqb8cce5tk\nGet the game on Steam ($5): https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102370/Dr_Derks_Mutant_Battlegrounds/\n\n###\n\nPress contact\nName: Fredrik Nor\xe9n\nEmail: noren@mountrouke.com\nPress kit: http://mountrouke.com/DerkPressKitJuly2020.zip\n")))))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));s.a.render(o.a.createElement(o.a.StrictMode,null,o.a.createElement(d,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))},3:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/MountRoukeLogo.79787eff.svg"},4:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/DerkLogo.14bc61bd.png"},6:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(25)}},[[6,1,2]]]);
